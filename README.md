# How to run
Simply clone or download the repository and run app.exe. If you are not under Windows, you can download sources at "https://github.com/ThibaultDieudonne/BlackJackExploit" and run "app.py" with your own python with Tkinter and PIL libraries installed.

# How to use
Two modes are available where you can specify the amount of decks in play (menu option).
Play mode is a play money game where you can bet against a virtual dealer. At any time you can find your optimal global EV (expected value) by running a full simulation with the specific deck composition. The software also gives you each possible action's EV depending on the deck composition, so you can train and learn.
Tracker mode helps you knowing the exact deck composition during a real game, and can find your optimal global EV. In this mode you can't look for best option, for obvious gambling addiction issues.

# More about Optimal Global EV
Each possible outcome is evaluated and weighted depending on the remaining amount of each card in the deck. To get fast solving, the full simulation uses some approximations for low occurence outcomes, which results in small relative errors but runs 10x faster. Moreover, complexity for exact splitting EV is not compatible with real time calculations so when splitting "XX vs Y", the software just double the "X vx Y" EV (with actual deck composition and every split rule applied). It is a good aproximation overall, but this can be really irrelevant for very small decks because the EV of the second hand depends a lot on the strategy used on the first. Keep in mind that no perfect calculator exists so it is hard to criticize my results. You can check  this 2008 research article "Exact Calculation of Expected Values for Splitting Pairs in Blackjack", where John A. Nairn achieves to make a perfect splitting calculator but for 1 deck only.
